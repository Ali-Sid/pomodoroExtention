# pomodoroExtention

The code sets up a Pomodoro timer and a timer with functions to start, stop, and reset each timer. It also defines a function to format the time in minutes and seconds.

The code adds event listeners to the Pomodoro and timer buttons, which hide and display certain HTML elements, respectively, and reset the timers. It also adds an event listener to the back button, which returns the user to the options screen. Finally, it adds event listeners to the start, stop, and reset buttons for the Pomodoro timer and timer, which enable and disable the buttons as appropriate and start, stop, or reset the relevant timer.

The DOMContentLoaded event listener ensures that the code within it only runs once the initial HTML document has been completely loaded and parsed [0]. The getElementById() method retrieves various elements from the HTML and assigns them to variables.

The setInterval() method is used to repeatedly execute a function at a specified time interval. It is used for both timers in this code [2].

The addEventListener() method is used to attach event listeners to various HTML elements, such as buttons and the DOMContentLoaded event [3]. The disabled property is used to enable or disable buttons as appropriate.

Overall, this code provides a simple Pomodoro timer and timer with basic functionality. It could be expanded upon to include additional features, such as sound effects or more customizable timer durations.
